                            <p>There was a time when religion was the most powerful political force in Europe, and later in the world. Kings were put on their thrones by the pope, wars were started and everyone was afraid of the power of the Church. Then things began to change. The true faith was gradually replaced by other powers. Science began to take over, politics changed; kings and popes were replaced by prime ministers and democratically elected parliaments. This inevitably led to people withdrawal from the <a href="http://www.crea8ivedesign.com/">Churches and Ministries</a>, no matter what religion they share. Then, with the new 21-st century things changed for the worse. The new digital generation does not believe in God so much, and do not feel the internal need of their fathers to go to confession or to pray 5 times a day or eat Kosher food – depending on what God they believe in.</p>
                            <p>This is a time that calls for new measures – young ones have to be befriended with their God again, using all modern age technologies. Every church and ministry tries to create its own web space, make its web page interesting to any one that visits, and try to bring him back to the Rabbi or the Priest or the Imam or whatever the religion community leader is called by that faith. The design of the page is crucial. If the logo design looks like it is made by the priest himself in Windows Paint, no one will take the temple seriously.
