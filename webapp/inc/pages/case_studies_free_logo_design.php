    <p>The area of <a href="/">free logo design</a> is very interesting. You may think you can get nothing for free in this world, but you will be wrong in the area of the design. Of course many logo designers around do offer <a href="/">free logo design</a>, but deliver nothing when you really attempt to contact them for its creation. So you how can you be sure you will get a logo at all and what are the risks?</p>

    <p>If you think you cannot afford to pay for a logo design, go get a free one. But always remember a few things about it. First, as you do not pay for it, the copyright is not transferred to your company, so be very careful, and keep the whole documentation you can, in case copyright issues arise, be it from the author or some of your competitor companies. The design can be gifted to you, so this is not a fatal flaw, just keep it in mind.</p>

    <p>Second, be careful about the quality, as with most things in the world, the <a href="/">free logo design</a> will not be as refined as the paid design, but for many cases, it will be enough. You can always ask your friends or business partners what they would think for your new logo. You can mask it as survey, and if the result is good for your <a href="/">free logo design</a>, go ahead and use it, many designers will create great logos for free in the beginning of their career just to be able to build good portfolio.</p>

    <p>Third is connected with the second - be careful not to go to a company site to try and get a <a href="/">free logo design</a>. The catch here is that even though they will really create a great logo for you, they will do it with a catch - most often, in the file you will receive, a watermark will be added, that will prevent any real use of the <a href="/">free logo design</a>, and a certain price will have to be paid to have the watermark removed and receive a working logo. On the other hand, this is a great way to get a demo which will show what this companyâ€™s design team is capable of.</p>

    <p>And last but not least, if you get a single designer, not a company, try to get as much info about him, before asking him to do a free logo for you. Most designers out there in the beginning of their career are not so good, but with reading around the design forums and looking at some samples, you may find a diamond in the mud.</p>

    <p>And last, but not least, if you can spare a little money and get a paid designer or team of designers, do it. <a href="/">Free logo design</a> will always be the riskier option, and in most  cases the paid designer will deliver better results and will have more experience in the area, to allow him do better job for you. If you cannot - well, the <a href="/">free logo design</a> is better than no logo design at all.</p>
