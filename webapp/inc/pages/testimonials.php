                            <h4>"A consistent look"</h4>

                            <p>Crea8ive Design created a fantastic logo and web site for me. Once I saw the quality of work, I had them design my
                                letterhead and envelopes, too. Having a consistent look to our graphic pieces shows our prospects and customers that we
                                care about quality and will deliver what we promise. I tried to create my own logo at first. I have a copy of Illustrator
                                so thought I could do it. The idea seemed simple but the software was a little confusing. </p>

                            <p class="full">I was able to make one, but it lacked the polish and detail that I wanted. I spent a lot of time working on it and finally sought help.
                                In the end, spending – or wasting – even 4 hours on it was not a good decision, and I spent much longer than that. For $99, I got exactly what I envisioned.</p>

                            <h4>"Truly remarkable"</h4>
                            <p>The professional and prompt delivery of Crea8ive Design was extraordinary. I admit, I wasn't expecting such great results

                                for the price I was willing to pay. As a small business starting out, we knew we couldn't afford everything we wanted.

                                Buy a cheaper desk, look for deal on phones, wait for a sale on a printer – we did what we could do to save money.

                                The logo was in the same category as other items.</p>
                            <p class="full">Sure it is important, but we could always change it and get a better looking one later, in a year or two.

                                We just needed something to get us started on our shoestring budget. What we received was truly remarkable. By having

                                a choice of a few concepts to choose from, we could see a whole different view. We got to decide how we wanted our image

                                to be portrayed and couldn't be happier.</p>

                            <h4>"Affordable quality"</h4>
                            <p>When the need came up for a new logo, my accountant recommended a client of his, my lawyer recommended a client of

                                hers and my partner suggested we look on the Internet. We talked with the others who were recommended to us.

                                They were nice enough and seemed competent enough to design a logo, but something was missing in their approach.

                                They were friendly, but more or less didn't seem interested in really creating a stunning look. </p>
                            <p class="full">I know we weren't their best client. All I ask is to act like we are. In the end, we selected Crea8ive Design.

                                For our money, we selected Crea8ive Designs because their process for the work is easy to follow and makes sense.

                                We told them what we want and they delivered a few samples that were great. Affordable quality won out in the end.</p>

                            <p>"Thank you, Crea8ive, for the wonderful work on our logo. My daughter's youth soccer team

                                needed a distinctive design and you delivered. As parents, we thought we knew best, but our

                                daughters suggested we look online for a service provider who could design the artwork they wanted.

                                The company who supplied our uniforms had created the logo in the past, but we couldn't use it anywhere else due to </p>
                            <p class="full">restrictions. He didn’t want to give us the artwork because he thought we wouldn't use him for the uniforms.

                                His prices were too high on some of the other clothing items and other things the team needed. With a small

                                budget, we had to be smart. By investing $99 upfront, we can now source our clothing, equipment bags and

                                everything else from the supplier we select."</p>

                            <h4>"Every conceivable format"</h4>
                            <p>We 'inherited' our logo when we bought the business from a long-time owner.

                                He wasn't into advertising or digital media, so we were limited on what we could do.

                                Our business was suffering a little because we couldn't advertise where we wanted and

                                if we did, the logo looked grainy or blurry because all we had was a photocopy of one.

                                When we would send it to the advertiser or newspaper,

                                they told us it wouldn't look good. The photocopying wasn't cutting it.</p>
                            <p class="full">So we sent it to Crea8ive Designs. Their design team was able to clean it up and they delivered the finished

                                work in every conceivable format. We even changed it slightly, updating our look and making it more modern and

                                bold, kind of like how we run our flower shop. We now can promote our business anywhere knowing we have the artwork

                                that we need.</p>

                            <p> It is not often that I am driven to write a thank you to a company I have never met face to face,

                                but I find myself doing just that right now. Some may argue that the internet has made the world

                                less personable, but shrinking the size of the world is no small accomplishment. We came across

                                your website by chance when we were searching for something else on Google. At first,

                                I didn't really think about </p>
                            <p class="full">where you were and it didn't really matter to be honest. Online, everyone can have a "shop".

                                When you delivered the level of service that you did, I then realized you weren't down the street,

                                even though I felt as if you were, but rather across the globe. It made the service and delivery

                                that much more impressive. Thank you for a tremendous job.</p>
