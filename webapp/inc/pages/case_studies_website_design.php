    <p>If you are a person who doesn’t have a firm background in <a href="/">website
            design</a> area, but you want to make one of these, you will need
        some explanations on the matter. This will prevent future problems and
        will also help you to know what to expect and request from your
        designers.</p>

    <p>The <a href="/">website design</a> is separated in two basic types
        according to contents: it can be static one or a dynamic one. The static
        site is with content that will not change in the future or only barely
        change. There are personal sites or company pages filled with
        information which visitors will just read and look at without the need
        to add contents or make anything else on the site. This type of site is
        very easy to make by the designer and will most probably be created very
        fast.</p>

    <p>On the other hand the dynamic <a href="/">website design</a> is with
        contents that can be changed in realtime by the creator or the activity
        of the visitors. Such sites are forums, blogs, most online portals, news
        sites, online shops etc.</p>

    <p>It’s very important when you want a <a href="/">website design</a> made
        to know what is the kind of site which you need - static or dynamic.
        Also, you must have a vision of how much revenue you will have by each
        possible client visiting your site, as the budget will be also an
        important factor when you decide what site you need created. When you
        clean this information in your mind you can make your budget and follow
        the next step - the actual site design.</p>

    <p>The prices for the static site depends on how much information you want
        to put on it, will you want something more complicated, do you have a
        domain already etc. On the other hand for the dynamic <a href="/">website
            design</a> the prices depend mainly on how much scripting will have
        to be created from scratch, and how much of the code is readily
        available.</p>

    <p>During the process of <a href="/">website design</a> the first stage of
        optimization which will make Google find the right words on the right
        places must be done. It’s called primary SEO - search engine
        optimization. So if you later want to do a full optimization of your
        whole <a href="/">website design</a> it will be much easier because a
        half of the work will already be finished and the designers will have
        put the links in your site and its SEO is mostly done. If you can order
        a full SEO to be done at the time of the website creation, do it, as
        this will save you both money and later efforts.</p>

    <p>If already have your <a href="/">website design</a> ready but you decide
        that you need some optimization, to become more popular it will be
        better to use professional designer too. Just don’t expect very fast
        results because they come very slowly and may take weeks even months for
        your site to start climbing up in the charts. The process of search
        engines passing through your site, getting your SEO content and indexing
        it is usually taking about a week. Than the new visitors must see it,
        visit you, raising your rank in the process and so on and so on. But one
        the whole thing starts it is guaranteed to bring your business to new,
        unimaginable heights. </p>
