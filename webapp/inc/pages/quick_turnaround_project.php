    </h1>

        <p>Good things come to those who wait – so goes a famous proverb. But in today's business climate, things happen at the speed of light on SLOW days.</p>
        <p>It is for this reason that Crea8ive Design has established our business processes to take advantage of efficiencies that condense the steps usually needed to create graphical art like a custom logo. We start by understanding your project completely, getting to know your particular needs and using our experience to understand your market. It goes without saying that we use a different set of style designs when creating a logo for a nightclub compared to when we create one for an accountant.</p>
        <p>Then, we focus on eliminating unnecessary steps along the way and involve experts whose core competencies deal directly with the task at hand. Because they are experts, there is no learning curve and they produce wonderful art in a short amount of time.</p>
        <p>Your project is not reliant on one member of our staff to handle it from start to finish. You have a full team working for you. The collective effort of the team is what allows us to deliver astonishingly beautiful artwork in an incredibly short period of time.</p>

                    <p>
                        As we create your custom logo, you are an active participant in the <a href="/pages/how_it_works">process</a>. <br>
                        Here is how:
                    </p>

                    <ol class="numeric">
                        <li><span>Select the <a href="/pages/prices_packages_logodesign">Design Package</a> that best suits your needs.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Complete the Project Instructions form as completely and descriptively as you can. This is what your Team will use as they design your logo.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Give us feedback on revisions in a timely manner when we request it. You can make as many revisions as you wish, but remember that each new revision can add up to two days to complete.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Select a final approved version. Your artwork is available for download immediately after you approve the final revisions.</span></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h2 class="title">Here is how you can make sure we deliver your<br>  <span class="orange">project on-time for you:</span></h2>

                <div>
                    <ol class="numeric">
                        <li><span>When you complete the Project Instructions form, provide as much information as you can about the project. Tell us about how you want to use the logo, your style preferences, favorite colors and even give a link to a logo or design you have seen that impressed you.</span></li>
                        <li><span>For revisions, the same rule of thumb applies. We WANT to correct any flaws and eliminate your hesitation, so don't be afraid to tell us like it is.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Your feedback is critical in creating your perfect custom logo. When you talk to the Design Team, be completely honest. They can handle the criticism, because they are driven to satisfy you. However, they are not mind readers, so they do not know what is inside your head. Tell us what you like and, more importantly, what you do not like about a design when you are submitting a revision. It helps take out the guesswork.</span></li>
                    </ol>
