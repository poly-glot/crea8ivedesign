                <p>This step is where your Crea8ive Design team begins working on impressing you with their talent.
                    Over the course of 2-3 days, they create the initial concepts for your graphical needs – the logo, stationery,
                    web site or whatever your project consists of.</p>

                    Depending on the package you selected, you are now looking at up to eight different conceptual designs.
                    From these concepts, select the one you want to use for your needs.</p>

                <p>This step separates us from the rest. It is where you have complete control over the final look of your custom design.
                    Study your custom artwork, get some opinions on it and share it with others. If you don't like a certain feature,
                    let your <a href="/pages/our_logo_designer">Crea8ive Design team</a> know. We will revise your logo until you are 100% completely satisfied
                    with the end result.</p>

                    your Crea8ive Design team delivers to you a portfolio of Master versions. For each piece of artwork, we prepare multiple
                    file formats that are required, depending on how you use your logo. Outdoor signage, printed materials, online use and
                    electronic communications all have different standards for graphical elements. We give you everything you need to use your
                    new artwork wherever it is needed.</p>
